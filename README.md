# Programming Language Foundations in Agda
I didn't do all the exercises
## Part 1: Logical Foundations
- [x] Naturals: Natural numbers
- [x] Induction: Proof by Induction
- [x] Relations: Inductive definition of relations
- [x] Equality: Equality and equational reasoning
- [x] Isomorphism: Isomorphism and Embedding
- [x] Connectives: Conjunction, disjunction, and implication
- [x] Negation: Negation, with intuitionistic and classical logic
- [x] Quantifiers: Universals and existentials
- [x] Decidable: Booleans and decision procedures
- [x] Lists: Lists and higher-order functions
## Part 2: Programming Language Foundations
- [x] Lambda: Introduction to Lambda Calculus
- [ ] Properties: Progress and Preservation
- [ ] DeBruijn: Intrinsically-typed de Bruijn representation
- [ ] More: Additional constructs of simply-typed lambda calculus
- [ ] Bisimulation: Relating reduction systems
- [ ] Inference: Bidirectional type inference
- [ ] Untyped: Untyped lambda calculus with full normalisation
- [ ] Confluence: Confluence of untyped lambda calculus
- [ ] BigStep: Big-step semantics of untyped lambda calculus
## Part 3: Denotational Semantics
- [ ] Denotational: Denotational semantics of untyped lambda calculus
- [ ] Compositional: The denotational semantics is compositional
- [ ] Soundness: Soundness of reduction with respect to denotational semantics
- [ ] Adequacy: Adequacy of denotational semantics with respect to operational semantics
- [ ] ContextualEquivalence: Denotational equality implies contextual equivalence
